Can someone explain it in a little more detail?\\n\\n- [Tutor]: The sky appears blue to the human eye because of the way Earth's atmosphere scatters sunlight. Sunlight is made up of a spectrum of colors that range from red to violet. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles, such as nitrogen and oxygen. This process is known as Rayleigh scattering.\\n\\n\\nRayleigh scattering is more effective at shorter wavelengths (the blue end of the visible spectrum). As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered in all directions by the gases and particles in the air. This scattered blue light is what we see when we look at the sky. The longer wavelengths, such as red and yellow, pass straight through the atmosphere and are less scattered, which is why the sky looks a deeper blue during the day and can take on shades of orange and red during sunrise and sunset when the sunlight path through the atmosphere is longer and more scattering occurs.\\n\\n\\nThe explanation you found on the website you mentioned provides a detailed and scientific understanding of this phenomenon. It explains that the color of the sky is not due to the color of the sky itself, but rather the way sunlight is scattered by the atmosphere. The blue color is a result of the preferential scattering of shorter blue wavelengths over the longer wavelengths.\""

The answer lies in the scattering of light by the atmosphere.\\n\\nWhen the sun sets or rises, the light has to pass through the Earth's atmosphere to reach our eyes. The atmosphere is made up of various gases, mainly nitrogen and oxygen. When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it encounters these gas molecules and gets scattered in all directions. Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels in shorter, smaller waves. This scattering of blue light is what makes the sky appear blue during the day.\\n\\nHowever, during sunrise or sunset, the sky can take on a range of colors, from pink and orange to red and purple. This is because the sun is lower in the sky, and the light has to pass through more of the atmosphere. The scattering of light causes the sun's rays to be refracted, or bent, and the longer wavelengths of light, such as red and orange, are more likely to be scattered, creating the beautiful colors we see in the sky.\\n\\nSo there you have it - the reason the sky is blue (or other colors) is due to the scattering of light by the Earth's atmosphere!\""
